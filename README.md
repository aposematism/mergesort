# mergesort
This contains four different sorting algorithms, each of which is implemented different. Tests included.
Four implementations of a sorting algorithm.
1. Insertion Sort
2. Sequential Mergesort.
3. Forkjoin Mergesort.
4. Future based Mergesort.

A number of tests using floats, strings, int etc have been implemented to test the relative efficiency of the different algorithms.
Effectively it demonstrates the careful thinking necessary to properly implement concurrent or parallel algorithms.
